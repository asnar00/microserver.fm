# Demo

author: asnaroo

`Demo` is a demo program to test `fnf.ts` (*Feature Normal Form*) - the build system that processes these .md files and spits out working typescript.

    feature Demo extends Feature;

To run the demo, we'll define an empty `demo` function:

    def demo() { console.log("ᕦ(ツ)ᕤ"); }

And here's a test just to see what happens:

    demo() ==> undefined

## children

### [Hello](./Demo/Hello.md)

Says 'hello world' like all good hello world programs should.

---

### [Countdown](./Demo/Countdown.md)

To add a bit of drama, let's count down from 10 to 1 before the big hello.

---

### [Goodbye](./Demo/Goodbye.md)

To be polite, let's sign off with "thanks bye!"
